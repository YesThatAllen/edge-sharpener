The Memo includes the Customer Name, as well as the document number on which the payment was taken.\r\n\r\nThis allows for clearer delineation of payment types, and improved reporting.\r\n\r\nThere is no current mechanism for ensuring Customers in LightSpeed Pro are synced with AccountEdge, so Edge Sharpener sets Payor for all payments is a single \"Imported Payment\" Payor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Sales\r\nMemo re-organization for clarity & easier sorting.\r\n\r\n### Transfers\r\nMemo re-organization for clarity & easier sorting.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
