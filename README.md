edge-sharpener
==============

A tool to optimize how LightSpeed and AccountEdge work


LightSpeed generates up to 5 exports files with every batch.

Inventory Adjustments

Miscellaneous Purchases

Payments

Sales

Transfers


By default, Payments and Sales import into MYOB/AccountEdge as General Journal entries, making management & sorting more difficult than it would be if they were true payments or sales.

The purpose of this tool is to better-ify the imports and create true payments with payment methods, and assigning sales to a customer, for ease in sorting.


Outside the Scope of the current build:

Assigning sales to their customer record.

Multiple store locations have not been considered.
